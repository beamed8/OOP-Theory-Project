### Inheritance
I've created a parent **Paint** class and 2 child classes named *OrangePaint* and *BluePaint* that are both deriving from parent Paint class.

### Polymorphism
*OrangePaint* class **overrides** *Paint*'s PaintObject() function to add a particle effect to the painted object.

### Abstraction
*GameManager* class has clean and reusable high-level functions.

### Encapsulation
*GameManager* has a static instance with private setter to prevent accidentally breaking such important class.
